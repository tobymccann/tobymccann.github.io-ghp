Summary: My thoughts on DevOps for NetOps in 2017

My job in network engineering is exciting, interesting and at times fun. That being said, I've always thought there are better
ways to manage networks than what most Enterprises have over the last 20-25 years.  Incumbent network vendors (I'm looking at you Cisco)
have developed formulas for generating revenue and keeping shareholders relatively happy over the years.  Product Managers at Cisco and other
large networking vendors, have a lot of sway in their organization which has also led to some unfortunate and important issues for customers and
the enterprise network industry.
