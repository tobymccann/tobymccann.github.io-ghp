Summary:  In my first post, I will detail how I setup my blog using the static site generator Pelican, Docker and GitHub Pages


I am documenting my effort to run a blog using the python-based static site generator,[Pelican](http://getpelican.com),
running on GitHub Pages and using a Docker container for development workflow.  

I started off by reviewing what others had done on some of the blogs I read.  Since I wanted to use this as a way to integrate Docker containers 
and CI/CD into my workflow, I did some google-fu.  I came upon Cyrille Roddant's [site](http://cyrille.rossant.net/pelican-github/) and decided to 
give his workflow a try.

I wanted to make a couple of changes from Cyrille's workflow, namely having two separate git repos: one for building the site and one for publishing
the site.  This could be accomplished with one git repository and branching, but I prefer the separate repo method (for now). I also was not interested
in auto-publishing my CV/resume using LaTeX so I cut that portion out.

Rather than clone or fork Cyrille's repo, I created my own from scratch and installed pelican locally on my macos in a virtualenv.  Next, I filled out
some personal preferences and used Cyrille's blog post as a guide for setting up the rest of the configuration files.  

Here's a snippet from my pelicanconf.py file:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- #
from __future__ import unicode_literals

AUTHOR = 'Jason Kennemer'
SITENAME = 'NewOps'
SITEURL = ''

PATH = 'content'
THEME = 'themes/pelican-alchemy/alchemy'

TIMEZONE = 'US/Central'

DEFAULT_LANG = 'en'
# Extract a post's date from the filename:
#FILENAME_METADATA = '(?P<date>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})-(?P<slug>.*)'
PAGE_URL = 'pages/{slug}.html'
PAGE_SAVE_AS = 'pages/{slug}.html'
STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'widgets', 'extra']
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
    'images/favicon.png': {'path': 'favicon.png'},
    'extra/CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},
}

PLUGIN_PATHS = ['pelican-plugins', 'plugins']
# Pelican plugins:
PLUGINS = [  # These plugins are part of the official `pelican-plugins` repo:
           'render_math',
           'summary',
           'neighbors',
           'pelican-bootstrapify'
           ]

BOOTSTRAPIFY = {
    'table': ['table', 'table-striped', 'table-hover'],
    'img': ['img-fluid'],
    'blockquote': ['blockquote'],
}

PYGMENTS_STYLE = 'monokai'

HIDE_AUTHORS = True

DIRECT_TEMPLATES = ['index', 'tags', 'categories', 'authors', 'archives', 'sitemap']
SITEMAP_SAVE_AS = 'sitemap.xml'

# Feed generation is usually not desired when developing
FEED_ALL_ATOM = None
CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = None
TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM = None
AUTHOR_FEED_ATOM = None
AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = None

# Blogroll
LINKS = (('github', 'https://github.com/tobymccann'),)

# Social widget
SOCIAL = (('twitter', '@tobymccann'),
          ('instagram', '@tobymccann'),)

TWITTER_USERNAME = 'tobymccann'
GITHUB_USERNAME = 'tobymccann'

DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10

GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = "UA-blahblah-1"

# Uncomment following line if you want document-relative URLs when developing
# RELATIVE_URLS = True

OUTPUT_RETENTION = [".git"]
```

I skipped down to the Docker setup which was rather straight forward.  From some previous Docker experience, I decided to 
combine the updates and installed in a single RUN statement:

```
FROM python:3.6.1-slim
MAINTAINER tobymccann <jason@kennemers.com@>

# Install dependencies
RUN sed -i 's/# \(.*multiverse$\)/\1/g' /etc/apt/sources.list \
  && apt-get update \
  && apt-get -y upgrade \
  && apt-get install \
  make \
  git -y \
  && pip install pelican Markdown typogrify ghp-import BeautifulSoup4 \
  && pip install --upgrade pelican Markdown typogrify ghp-import BeautifulSoup4

RUN git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins /site/

WORKDIR /site
# Need to mount /site/content
CMD pelican content/ -o output/ -s publishconf.py
```

I built, tagged and uploaded my image to Dockerhub and ensured it would build properly, which it did after a few tries.

Finally, I configured TravisCI using Cyrille's yaml file as an example, but made several adjustments along the way since 
I wasn't pushing to Master in the same repo, and I wasn't developing from a "sources" branch in the development repo.

```
branches:
  only:
  - master
language: python
python:
  - 3.6
sudo: required
services:
  - docker
install:
  - pip install ghp-import
  - git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins
script:
  - make github
notifications:
  email:
    on_success: always
    on_failure: always
env:
  global:
    secure: "xxxxxxxxxxx"
before_install:
  - git submodule update --init --recursive
```

And that's mainly it.  I use a python script to generate a very basic Markdown file for each post, then I edit the Markdown (as I'm doing now) in PyCharm
and save, commit and push.  TravisCI will build the site using my Docker image along with my content and if all is successful, my site 
will be updated via the build process in Travis.
